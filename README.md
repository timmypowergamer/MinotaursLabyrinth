# Minotaurs Labyrinth
A quick gamejam made in about 8 hours. Parses and solves asciiArt mazes via depth-mapping, then lets you walk a character through the maze, or use the auto-solve feature to have him find his own way from anywhere in the maze. Will always take the most efficient path to the end.
Has 3 built-in maps, plus the ability to load your own asciiArt maze files in the form of .txt
